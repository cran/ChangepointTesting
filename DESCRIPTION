Description: A multiple testing procedure for clustered alternative hypotheses. 
    It is assumed that the p-values under the null hypotheses follow U(0,1) and 
    that the distributions of p-values from the alternative hypotheses are 
    stochastically smaller than U(0,1). By aggregating information, this 
    method is more sensitive to detecting signals of low magnitude than 
    standard methods. Additionally, sporadic small p-values appearing 
    within a null hypotheses sequence are avoided by averaging on the 
    neighboring p-values.
